Evaluate this document against the rubric below, paying SPECIAL ATTENTION to chunking optimization.

ACTUAL CHUNK BREAKDOWN (how the AI Agent system will split this document):
{{CHUNK_PREVIEW}}

ANALYZE THE CHUNKS ABOVE:
- Look for orphaned headers (headers in chunks without their content)
- Check if related info spans too many chunks (remember: only 5 retrieved!)
- Identify bullet lists/tables that create many small "sentences"
- Ensure each chunk is semantically complete and useful on its own

KEY CHUNKING RULES:
- Splits on: (?<=[.!?])\s+(?=[A-Z]) OR \n+ (newlines)
- Each line break creates a sentence boundary
- Grouped into exactly 6 sentences per chunk (no overlap)
- **CRITICAL: Only 5 chunks are retrieved from database per query**
- Bullet points and tables chunk poorly (each line = new sentence)

ECOMMERCE CONTEXT:
These documents are for AI agents helping ecommerce merchants. Users primarily ask about:
- Return policies and processes
- Shipping methods, rates, and timeframes
- Exchange procedures
- Product-specific information (sizing, materials, care instructions)

Common chunking problems in ecommerce docs:
- Shipping rate tables split from method names (e.g., "Ground Shipping" header separated from rates)
- Multiple shipping methods in separate chunks (Ground, Standard, Express) - only 5 chunks retrieved means incomplete info
- Long bullet lists split across chunks - some bullets lost due to 5-fragment limit
- Return eligibility criteria separated from return instructions
- Product condition requirements split from return/exchange policies
- Time limits (e.g., "30-day return window") separated from their context
- Tables that span many lines get chunked poorly and incompletely retrieved

EVALUATION CRITERIA - Include chunking-specific suggestions:
- "Document Structure & Chunking": Evaluate if content is organized for optimal chunking. Flag issues like:
  * Headers separated from content (CRITICAL for shipping/return sections)
  * Related information split across likely chunk boundaries (e.g., rates split from shipping methods)
  * **Using bullet points or tables** - these are NOT handled well by the chunker, recommend prose instead
  * **Multiple related sections** (e.g., Ground, Standard, Express shipping) - with only 5 fragments retrieved, separate sections mean incomplete info. Recommend consolidating related options into single, concise sections
  * Lists or tables that span too many lines (especially rate tables, return conditions)
  * Missing context that makes chunks unclear (e.g., a chunk with only rates but no method name)
  * Policies split from their eligibility criteria or timeframes
  * Information spread across too many potential chunks (remember: only 5 retrieved!)
- "Ecommerce Clarity": Ensure policies are clear, complete, and structured for retrieval:
  * Return windows must be stated with the policy (not orphaned)
  * Shipping costs must be with shipping method descriptions
  * Exchange conditions must be with exchange instructions
  * Product specifics grouped logically (sizing with size charts, not split)
  * **Consolidate related options** (e.g., all shipping methods in one compact section) to ensure complete retrieval within 5-fragment limit
  * **Avoid bullet lists and tables** - convert to narrative prose that chunks cleanly
- Follow all other rubric criteria as well
